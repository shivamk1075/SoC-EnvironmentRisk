NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
NDVI shows how green or healthy the vegetation is by comparing how much red light is absorbed and how much near-infrared light is reflected by plants.

Higher values (close to +1) indicate healthy vegetation, while lower or negative values point to barren land, built-up areas, or water.

NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index)
NDBI helps identify urban or built-up areas by measuring the contrast between shortwave infrared and near-infrared reflectance.

Higher values suggest man-made surfaces like buildings and roads, while lower values usually represent vegetation or water bodies.
